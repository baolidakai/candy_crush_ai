Code structures:
utils.py - Utility functions and constants shared my all other files.
candy\_crush\_game.py - Game controller.
config\_generator.py - Generator for a random configuration.
candy\_crush\_board.py - Main object of the game, represents a game state, and can be interacted with.

To generate a random configuration:
```
python config_generator.py 200 10 5 config1.txt
```

TODOs:
* a naive AI baseline
* reinforcement learning part
